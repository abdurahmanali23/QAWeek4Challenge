# QAWeek4Challenge

What was the challenge?

To make a calculator

How I expected the challenge to go.

challenging as I didn't practice enough javascript.

What went well?

html

What didn't go as planned?

the javascript was harder to do than I though.

Possible improvements for future challenges

I need more time to fully understand the languages before being able to make something.
